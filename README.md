# Data-Mining-Association-Rules

- This is an example of using Association Rules to describe patterns among the set of input variables (unsupervised learning)
- The dataset is available online (check the references). If having trouble finding it contact me.
- You need the "datamining.bib" in your working directory to compile the Rmd file.
- the "datamining.bib" stores the references. If not familiar with Bibtex, just delete the "bibliography: .... datamining.bib" from the Rmd preamble (12th line) - it compiles without the citations and refs
you can always check the references from the pdf file
